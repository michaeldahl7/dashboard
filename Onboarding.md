The flow would be:
User signs up/logs in
Sets username (required for mentions/URLs)
3. Either:
Creates a new house (becomes owner)
OR joins existing house via invite
Sets up default inventory locations
Redirects to dashboard
Key points:
Username is important for URLs and mentions
Houses enable multi-user collaboration
Default inventory locations make it easier to get started
Each step builds on the previous
Users can be invited at any time
Clear progression through onboarding
Would you like me to show how to implement any specific part of this flow in more detail?
